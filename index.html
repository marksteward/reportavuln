            <h2>What</h2>

            <div class="hr hr-small hr-center"></div>

            <p>Doing the right thing basically means telling those responsible for the service or product that it is vulnerable and is putting users at risk.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="span8 offset2 i-block">
            <h3>Non Disclosure</h3>
            <h5>Let them know, then sit back, relax and forget about it.</h5>
            <p>The idea here is that you do not disclose the vulernability to the public. Instead, you notify the owner, provide them with the relevant details then let them get on with it. Unfortunately, a lot of vendors and services do not take responsiblity for such security problems and could simply ignore your notification without ever fixing the problem. This means users remain at risk. The other form of non disclosure is simply not to inform the vendor and to keep the details to yourself (or exploit them in some way). However, this isn't really doing the right thing, so won't be considered here.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="hr hr-invisible"></div>

        <div class="row">

            <h3>Responsible Disclosure</h3>
            <h5>Let them know, but give them a time frame in which to fix the issue. Then go public.</h5>

            <p>Instead of just notifying them and forgetting about it, you can give them a time frame in which they need to fix the issue before you go public with the vulnerability. This puts pressure on the vendor to actually fix it, otherwise they could face bad publicity and further ramifications of the details going public. A time frame of one or two months should probably do, but you might need to adjust it depending on the severity of the problem.</p>

            <p>The danger here is that they might still ignore you which means you either have to give in or go public. If you go public, you might be directly putting the users at risk as anyone can now use that vulnerability. Having said that, it isn't your responsibility and you did try. Maybe.</p>

            <p>If their website doesn't explicitly mention how to notifying them of security issues, then you might want to try sending them an email. RFC 2142 suggests the use of security@domain but if that doesn't work you can also try hostmaster@domain and webmaster@domain.</p>

The danger here is that you don't know who will have access to your notification and it could get into the wrong hands. Ideally you would contact a security team directly, but this is generally not an option for most support channels.</p>

            <h5>Temporary email and TOR</h5>
            <p>There have been a number of cases recently where a security researcher has had threatening legal letters and even a visit from the police, all for just trying to do the right thing. Telling a company that their software is broken can potentially upset them. Rather than take responsibility for the problem, they might try to blame you. They might claim you were attempting to "hack" them. They might get lawyers involved. Or the police. If you want to protect yourself from potential hassle, you could consider using <a href="https://www.torproject.org/">TOR</a> to access a temporary email service such as <a href="http://10minutemail.com/">10 Minute Mail</a>.</p>

            <p>If they have a disclosure policy then it suggests they may have at least thought about the possibility of having to handle a vulnerability notification. Hopefully they will accept the notification with gratitude and will take it seriously. Or at least give you a realistic time frame. You may even feel comfortable sending the notification as yourself so they can get back to you if required.</p>

            <h5>The time has finally come...</h5>
            <p>If you chose to disclose the vulnerability responsibly and gave them a time frame in which to fix the problem, it is entirely possible that for one reason or another they won't have fixed the issue on time. They might even ask you for more time. But at some point you might just decide to go public. As with the notification, you have the choice of doing it anonymously or using your identity. You could contact a major IT news website and give them the details, or you could post to the <a href="http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/">Full Disclosure Mailing List</a>.</p>
